# calculator
This is my implementation of a text-based calculator in Python2.7. Can handle basic arithmetic, logarithmic, and trigonometric operations with real numbers. Evaluates each expression using operator precedence and parentheses.\
Asks user for an equation to calculate and parses the mathematical formula from the input string. Uses Dijkstra's Shunting-yard algorithm to convert the input string into Reverse Polish Notation. Answers are calculated from the RPN and returned in radians.\
