# calculator
This is my implementation of a text-based calculator in Python2.7. Can handle basic arithmetic, logarithmic, and trigonometric operations with real numbers. Evaluates each expression using operator precedence and parentheses.
To run on MacOS, save the file to a location and remember the filepath. Open the terminal, type "python2 /path/to/file/calculator.py", and hit enter.
