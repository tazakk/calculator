# calculator
This is my implementation of a text-based calculator in Python2.7. Can handle basic arithmetic, logarithmic, and trigonometric operations with real numbers. Evaluates each expression using operator precedence and parentheses.\

To run:\
MacOS: Save the file to a location and remember the filepath. Open the terminal, type "python2 /path/to/file/calculator.py", and hit enter.\
Linux: Save the file "calculator.py" to a location and remember the filepath. Open a command prompt, type "python ~/path/to/file/calculator.py", and hit enter.\
Windows: Save the file to a location and remember the filepath. Open up the command line. Type the path to the location where Python2.7 is installed (default is C:\python27\python.exe), the path to the file, and hit enter. Ex: "C:\python27\python.exe Z:\path\to\file\calculator.py"
